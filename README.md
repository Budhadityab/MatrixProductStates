# MatrixProductStates
This is a set of codes written in Julia as part of my learning process involving Matrix Product States, Operators, DMRG, TDVP and TEBD. 

The file "MPO-MPS-DMRG" contains some basic operations involving Matrix Product States and Operators. Some of these are the well-known "Zipper" operations, computing expectation values of MPOs and MPSs, finding the action of an MPO on an MPS etc. 

DMRG routine is still buggy.

The ultimate goal is to learn and apply PEPS and iPEPS-like algorithms.
